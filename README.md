## ðŸ’» Project

  * Car Blog homepage, called Clash of Cars.

## ðŸ“œ About:

Creation of the blog: Clash of Cars, with information and comparisons between Muscler Cars and Sports Cars.

## ðŸ§  Apprenticeship:

The creation of this project challenged me to understand and retain the contents learned in Stage 03 - Explorer on Rocketseat's teaching platform.

## 1 - What I've learned?

Some key concepts like:

* Mobile First: Responsive design on smaller screens to later adjust to a desktop version;
* Flexible measuring unit;
* Grid;
* Variables in CSS;
* HSL colors;
* Simple animations and transitions.
* anchor tag <a> - Responsible for linking other documents that the HTML has, internal and external links.
* placeholder - HTML attribute with a placeholder, which helps the user to fill in forms.

## 1.1 - Building the HTML Structure with:

 * header
 * main
 * aside
 * footer

## 2- How did I apply?

Created in a practical way through a basic structure in HTML and a style in CSS, fixing the main concepts that were applied in a WEB page.
